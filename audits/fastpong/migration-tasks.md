# Codex Migration Task Plan

Project: **fastpong**

This plan turns the audit into small Codex-ready migration prompts. Paste one task at a time into Codex and complete validation before moving to the next task.

## Task 1 — Baseline Verification

### Goal

- Establish a clean baseline before making any migration changes.

### Context from audit

### Forbidden changes

- Do not edit app, native, or dependency files in this task.
- Do not make broad rewrites.
- Do not change business logic unless required for the migration.
- Do not remove files unless clearly obsolete and justified.
- Do not silence TypeScript errors without explaining why.
- Do not edit generated files manually unless required.
- Keep changes small and commit-ready.
- If unsure, document the blocker instead of guessing.

### Files to inspect

- package.json
- README*
- ios/
- android/

### Implementation instructions

- Inspect the repository before editing.
- Install dependencies with the current package manager if needed.

- Do not continue to the next task until validation is complete or blockers are documented.

### Validation commands

- yarn install
- yarn tsc

### Success criteria

- Baseline commands and failures are documented.
- No migration changes have been made yet.

### Rollback note

- No code rollback should be needed because this task should not edit code.

### Commit checkpoint

After this task passes validation, commit the isolated changes with a clear message, for example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Document baseline verification before migration"
```

## Task 2 — Create Migration Branch

- yarn ios — Run if the local iOS/Android environment is available. If not available, document the blocker and required environment.

### Success criteria

- Potential references are classified as confirmed usage or false positives.

### Rollback note

- Revert any change made to a reference that turns out to be modern usage or plain text.

### Commit checkpoint

After this task passes validation, commit the isolated changes with a clear message, for example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Manually Verify Potential Legacy API References for RN migration"
```

## Task 17 — Final Verification

### Goal

- Run final verification after all staged migration changes are complete.

### Context from audit

- Recommended engagement: staged-upgrade.
- Final verification should happen after each upgrade stage and after the final target is reached.

### Allowed changes

- Fix only small issues discovered by final validation.

### Forbidden changes

- Do not start new feature work.
- Do not hide failing checks.
- Do not make broad rewrites.
- Do not change business logic unless required for the migration.
- Do not remove files unless clearly obsolete and justified.
- Do not silence TypeScript errors without explaining why.
- Do not edit generated files manually unless required.
- Keep changes small and commit-ready.
- If unsure, document the blocker instead of guessing.

### Files to inspect

- package.json
- report.md
- audit-result.json
- migration-tasks.md

### Implementation instructions

- Run all available validation commands.
- Verify Android and iOS builds if native folders exist.
- Prepare a short verification report listing passed checks, failed checks, and residual risks.
- Do not continue to the next task until validation is complete or blockers are documented.

### Validation commands

- yarn tsc
- yarn lint
- yarn test
- yarn android — Run if the local iOS/Android environment is available. If not available, document the blocker and required environment.
- yarn ios — Run if the local iOS/Android environment is available. If not available, document the blocker and required environment.

### Success criteria

- All available checks pass or blockers are documented with exact errors.
- No unrelated changes are included.
- A verification summary is ready for review.

### Rollback note

- If final verification fails, revert the smallest failing change set and rerun checks.

### Commit checkpoint

After this task passes validation, commit the isolated changes with a clear message, for example:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Document final migration verification"
```
